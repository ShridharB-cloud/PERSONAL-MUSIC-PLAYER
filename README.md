# 🚀 Project Title & Tagline
**MusicHub**: The ultimate music streaming platform, where users can discover, listen, and share their favorite songs and playlists.

## 📖 Description
MusicHub is a web-based music streaming application built with React, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and access a vast library of songs and playlists. The application features a user-friendly interface, with a robust search function, allowing users to easily find and listen to their favorite music. MusicHub also provides a social aspect, where users can create and share playlists, follow other users, and like/dislike songs.

The application is designed with a modular architecture, using a combination of React hooks, React Query, and Socket.IO for real-time updates. The backend API is built using Node.js and Express, with a PostgreSQL database for storing user data and music metadata. MusicHub also utilizes the Supabase library for authentication and authorization.

MusicHub aims to provide a seamless music streaming experience, with features such as playlist creation, song recommendation, and real-time updates. The application is designed to be scalable, with a focus on performance and user experience. With MusicHub, users can enjoy their favorite music, discover new artists, and connect with other music lovers.

The application's codebase is organized into several modules, each responsible for a specific functionality. The `music` module handles music-related logic, such as song retrieval and playlist management. The `auth` module handles user authentication and authorization, while the `api` module provides a interface for interacting with the backend API. The `utils` module contains utility functions for tasks such as string manipulation and DOM manipulation.
